# EX 30 C program to add two integer elements in an array using realloc() and that array already has three elements.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program to add two integer elements in an array using realloc() and that array already has three elements.

## Algorithm
1.Start

2.Allocate and reallocate memory for list using malloc() and realloc().

3.Check memory allocation, then assign values.

4.Print list elements using a loop.

5.Free memory and End. 
  

## Program:
```

 {
    int i;
    float *list;
    list = (float *)malloc(3 * sizeof(float));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        printf("Initial memory allocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    list[0] = 12.33;
    list[1] = 67.44;
    list[2] = 89.55;
    list = (float *)realloc(list, 5 * sizeof(float));
    if (list == NULL)
    {
        printf("Memory reallocation failed.\n");
        return 1;
    }
    list[3] = 20.21;
    list[4] = 32.67;
    printf("Result\n");
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        printf("%.2f ", list[i]);
    }
    printf("\n");
    free(list);
    returnÂ 0;
}
```
