# EX 27 C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a C program that demonstrates the use of typedef to create a new alias name for a data type.

## Algorithm
1.Start

2.Define a typedef MyInt as int for readability.

3.Declare and assign a variable num using MyInt.

4.Print the value of num.

5.End 
 
## Program:
```
/*

#include <stdio.h>
typedef int MyInt;
int main() {
 MyInt num = 10;
 printf("The value of num is: %d\n", num);
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:
